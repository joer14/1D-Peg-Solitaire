Input in form of number of pegs followed by a line break, then 0 1 1 1 0, etc. 0 represents a single peg while 1 represents a double peg. It strips whitespace automatically.

The hashtable is advantagous for inputs greater than 8 or so, although isn't needed in some cases such as input6.txt which has 14 pegs. This is due to the inital pattern 0110 which is unsolvable. One parameter I changed was the initial has table size. Before it was a power of 2, however, ideally it should a power of two offset by 1, as this improves performance. 


Add a short (half page) description of what you observed:
- For what type/size of inputs did the hash table give an advantage?
- If you tuned any parameters, what was your rationale?
- Anything else insightful
